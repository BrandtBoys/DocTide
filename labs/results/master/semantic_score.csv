0.56479996,def send_file,"""""""Send the contents of a file to the client.

    The first argument can be a file path or a file-like object. Paths
    are preferred in most cases because Werkzeug can manage the file and
    get extra information from the path. Passing a file-like object
    requires that the file is opened in binary mode, and is mostly
    useful when building a file in memory with :class:`io.BytesIO`.

    Never pass file paths provided by a user. The path is assumed to be
    trusted, so a user could craft a path to access a file you didn't
    intend. Use :func:`send_from_directory` to safely serve
    user-requested paths from within a directory.

    If the WSGI server sets a ``file_wrapper`` in ``environ``, it is
    used, otherwise Werkzeug's built-in wrapper is used. Alternatively,
    if the HTTP server supports ``X-Sendfile``, configuring Flask with
    ``USE_X_SENDFILE = True`` will tell the server to send the given
    path, which is much more efficient than reading it in Python.

    :param path_or_file: The path to the file to send, relative to the
        current working directory if a relative path is given.
        Alternatively, a file-like object opened in binary mode. Make
        sure the file pointer is seeked to the start of the data.
    :param mimetype: The MIME type to send for the file. If not
        provided, it will try to detect it from the file name.
    :param as_attachment: Indicate to a browser that it should offer to
        save the file instead of displaying it.
    :param download_name: The default name browsers will use when saving
        the file. Defaults to the passed file name.
    :param conditional: Enable conditional and range responses based on
        request headers. Requires passing a file path and ``environ``.
    :param etag: Calculate an ETag for the file, which requires passing
        a file path. Can also be a string to use instead.
    :param last_modified: The last modified time to send for the file,
        in seconds. If not provided, it will try to detect it from the
        file path.
    :param max_age: How long the client should cache the file, in
        seconds. If set, ``Cache-Control`` will be ``public``, otherwise
        it will be ``no-cache`` to prefer conditional caching.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0

        ``Content-Disposition: inline`` instead.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
        ``max_age`` replaces the ``cache_timeout`` parameter.
        ``conditional`` is enabled and ``max_age`` is not set by

Stream a generator or function with context.

This function takes an iterator or callable that returns an iterator, and wraps it in a context manager. The context manager pushes the current request context onto the stack when the generator is started, and pops it off when the iteration completes.

If the input is not an iterator, but rather a callable that returns an iterator, this function will wrap the callable in a decorator to create a new function that takes any arguments and returns an iterator. This allows the original function to be used as if it were an iterator.

The context manager uses the `_cv_request` object to get the current request context, and pushes it onto the stack when the generator is started. When the iteration completes, the context is popped off the stack.

This function can only be used when a request context is active, such as in a view function.

Args:
    generator_or_function: An iterator or callable that returns an iterator.

Returns:
    An iterator over the results of the input generator or function.

    This is done for efficiency reasons and to make it less likely to encounter
    memory leaks with badly written WSGI middlewares.  The downside is that if
    you are using streamed responses, the generator cannot access request bound
    information any more.

    This function however can help you keep the context around for longer::

        from flask import stream_with_context, request, Response

        @app.route('/stream')

Stream a generator or function with context.

This function takes an iterator or callable that returns an iterator, and wraps it in a context manager. The context manager pushes the current request context onto the stack when the generator is started, and pops it off when the iteration completes.

If the input is not a generator or function, but rather a decorator factory, this function will create a new decorator that takes arguments and keyword arguments, calls the original function with those arguments, and then wraps the result in another context manager.

The `stream_with_context` function can only be used when a request context is active, such as in a view function. If no request context is available, it raises a RuntimeError.

Returns:
    An iterator that yields the same values as the original generator or function, but with the added benefit of being able to use the current request context.
    A callable that takes an iterator and returns an iterator, if the input was not a generator or function.

using that environment. The `finally` block ensures the `EnvironBuilder` is properly
closed after use.

    **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the `EnvironBuilder`.

Returns:

WSGI Application Function

This function serves as the entry point for the WSGI application. It takes in an environment dictionary and a start response callable, 
and returns any response object generated by the application.

The function first creates a request context using `self.request_context(environ)`. It then attempts to execute the full dispatch of the request,
handling any exceptions that may occur during this process. If an exception is caught, it will be handled and propagated up the call stack.
Finally, the response object is returned to the caller.

Note: This function should not be called directly by users of the application. Instead, it should be used as part of a larger WSGI server or framework.
