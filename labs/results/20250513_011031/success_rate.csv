Test that a child Blueprint overrides the parent\'s subdomain.

This test ensures that when accessing the root URL of the application,
the child Blueprint is used instead of the parent, even if the request

default to using the child Blueprint when a request is made to the parent\'s
subdomain.

The test creates two Blueprints: one for the parent and one for the child.
It then registers the child Blueprint with the parent, but only after setting
the `client.allow_subdomain_redirects` flag to True. This allows the client
to make requests to the parent\'s subdomain without being redirected to the root.

Finally, the test makes two GET requests: one to the root URL of the application,
and one to the parent\'s subdomain. The first request should return a 200 status
code, indicating that the child Blueprint was used. The second request should
return a 404 status code, indicating that the parent Blueprint was not used.

Test the functionality of the `flask.flash` function.

This test suite checks that the `flask.flash` function correctly stores and retrieves
messages with different categories. It also tests that messages can be filtered by category.

The test suite consists of several routes, each testing a specific scenario:

- `/`: Tests flashing a message without specifying a category.
- `/test/`: Tests flashing multiple messages with different categories.
- `/test_with_categories/`: Tests flashing a message with a category and retrieving it.
- `/test_filter/`: Tests filtering messages by category.
- `/test_filters/`: Tests filtering messages by multiple categories.
- `/test_filters_without_returning_categories/`: Tests filtering messages without returning categories.

Each test uses the `app.test_client()` to simulate a request to the route, ensuring that
the flashed messages are properly cleaned after each test.

Note: Make sure to set `app.testing=True` before running these tests, as otherwise,
AssertionErrors in view functions will cause a 500 response instead of propagating exceptions.

The test suite consists of several routes, each testing a specific scenario:

- `/`: Tests flashing a message without specifying a category.
- `/test/`: Tests flashing multiple messages with different categories.
- `/test_with_categories/`: Tests flashing a message with a category and retrieving it.
- `/test_filter/`: Tests filtering messages by category.
- `/test_filters/`: Tests filtering messages by multiple categories.
- `/test_filters_without_returning_categories/`: Tests filtering messages without returning categories.

Each test uses the `app.test_client()` to simulate a request to the route, ensuring that
the flashed messages are properly cleaned after each test.

Note: Make sure to set `app.testing=True` before running these tests, as otherwise,
AssertionErrors in view functions will cause a 500 response instead of propagating exceptions.

- The third call to `flask.flash(flask.Markup(""<em>Testing</em>""), ""warning"")` sets a warning message containing HTML markup.

### Parameters

- `host`: The host IP address or hostname to bind to (default: None)
- `port`: The port number to use for the server (default: None)
- `debug`: Whether to enable debug mode (default: None, will override other sources)
- `load_dotenv`: Whether to load environment variables from a .env file (default: True)

### Returns

None. This function runs the Flask development server and does not return any value.

This function is used to run the Flask development server. It takes several parameters, including host, port, debug mode, and environment variables from a .env file. The `debug` parameter can override other sources of debug information. If no host or port are provided, it will use the default values. The `options` dictionary can be used to customize the behavior of the server.

### Example Usage

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=5000)

Test the functionality of the `flask.flash` function.

This test suite checks that the `flask.flash` function correctly stores and retrieves

The test suite consists of several routes, each testing a specific scenario:

- `/`: Tests flashing a message without specifying a category.
- `/test/`: Tests flashing multiple messages with different categories.
- `/test_with_categories/`: Tests flashing a message with a category and retrieving it.
- `/test_filter/`: Tests filtering messages by category.
- `/test_filters/`: Tests filtering messages by multiple categories.
- `/test_filters_without_returning_categories/`: Tests filtering messages without returning categories.

Each test uses the `app.test_client()` to simulate a request to the route, ensuring that
the flashed messages are properly cleaned after each test.

Test the functionality of the `flask.flash` function.

This test suite checks that the `flask.flash` function correctly stores and retrieves
messages with different categories. It also tests that messages can be filtered by category.

The test suite consists of several routes, each testing a specific scenario:

- `/`: Tests flashing a message without specifying a category.
- `/test/`: Tests flashing multiple messages with different categories.
- `/test_with_categories/`: Tests flashing a message with a category and retrieving it.
- `/test_filter/`: Tests filtering messages by category.
- `/test_filters/`: Tests filtering messages by multiple categories.
- `/test_filters_without_returning_categories/`: Tests filtering messages without returning categories.

Each test uses the `app.test_client()` to simulate a request to the route, ensuring that
the flashed messages are properly cleaned after each test.

Note: Make sure to set `app.testing=True` before running these tests, as otherwise,
AssertionErrors in view functions will cause a 500 response instead of propagating exceptions.

This function utilizes Flask\'s flash messaging system to display messages to the user.

Parameters:

Notes:
- The first call to `flask.flash(""Hello World"")` sets a default message type as \'success\'.
- The second call to `flask.flash(""Hello World"", ""error"")` overrides the previous message with an error type.
- The third call to `flask.flash(flask.Markup(""<em>Testing</em>""), ""warning"")` sets a warning message containing HTML markup.
