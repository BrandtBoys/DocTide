rnote over doctide_labs
    login to GitHub
    on forked repo
    using github PAT
endrnote
rnote over doctide_labs
    make a lists of
    commits from a set
    start commit to a
    set end commit
endrnote
forked_repo->doctide_labs : list of commits
rnote over doctide_labs
    The start_commit gets cleaned 
    for all existing comments, 
    leaving a black "canvas" for 
    the DocTide Action to work on
    without getting influenced by
    existing comments. 
endrnote
doctide_labs->test_branch : creates test branch from  "cleaned" start_commit
rnote over test_branch : start_commit
rnote over doctide_labs
    Adds a workflow which can invoke 
    our DocTide action
endrnote
doctide_labs->test_branch : test_workflow
loop for commit in commits
    rnote over doctide_labs
        Treats commits in the commit list
        as incoming commits to the
        test branch
    endrnote
    test_branch->doctide_labs : gets head commit (first run is start_commit)
    rnote over doctide_labs
        Takes next commit and gets
        files it is modifying using 
        diff_lib
    endrnote
    loop for file in diff.files
        rnote over doctide_labs
            Each file is "cleaned" meaning; in order to simulate
            a working repository, we take the incoming commit and 
            apply only its code changes, but not potential changes
            to function comments. Thereby simulating a developer 
            committing code, but trust DocTide to create the 
            function comments.
        endrnote
    end
    rnote over doctide_labs
        Now the cleaned files is commited
        to the test branch
    endrnote
    doctide_labs->test_branch : cleaned commit
    rnote over test_branch
        commit without new comments
    endrnote
    rnote over doctide_labs
        Now the test workflow is invoked
        which invokes the DocTide action
    endrnote
    doctide_labs->test_branch : invoked test_workflow
    test_branch-> DocTide_Action : test_workflow invokes the DocTide Action
    rnote over DocTide_Action
        Does its job, sees "commit without new comments"
        as the HEAD commit of test branch and start_commit (in
        the first run), or its own last contribution as HEAD~1
    endrnote
    DocTide_Action->test_branch : commits its generated comments
    rnote over test_branch
        updated function level documentation
    endrnote
    rnote over doctide_labs
        creates semantic score between the possible existing
        comments on the commit (before remove_diff_comments)
        and thee generated comments by the llm, and saves it
        to a csv file, for each commit
    endrnote
    rnote over doctide_labs
        collects the success rate, tracked by the agent and
        append it to a csv file
    endrnote
