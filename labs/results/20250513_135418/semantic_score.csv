Loads a Flask application instance.

This method attempts to load an existing Flask application from the `self._loaded_app` attribute,
or creates a new one if none exists. It also sets the debug flag of the loaded application
if `self.set_debug_flag` is True.

If no application can be found, it raises a `NoAppException`.

Returns:
    The loaded Flask application instance.
